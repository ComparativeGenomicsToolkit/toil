Toil
====

Toil is an open-source pure-Python workflow engine that lets people write better
pipelines. You can:

* Write your workflows in `Common Workflow Language`_ (CWL)
* Run workflows on your laptop or on huge commercial clouds such as
  `Amazon Web Services`_ (including the `spot market`_), `Microsoft Azure`_,
  `OpenStack`_, and `Google Compute Engine`_
* Take advantage of high-performance computing environments with batch systems
  like `GridEngine`_, `Apache Mesos`_, and `Parasol`_
* Run workflows concurrently at scale using hundreds of nodes and thousands of cores
* Execute workflows efficiently with caching and resource requirement specifications
* Easily link databases and services

Toil is, admittedly, not quite as good as sliced bread, but it's about as close
to it as you're gonna get.
